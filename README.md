# Epidemic Simulation

Epidemic simulation model developed for a pre-scientific paper on the spread of infectious diseases.

## Test it out

For trying out the simulation it is hosted on my personal website: https://nouhi.dev/epidemic-simulation

It offers an interactive simulation that lets you adjust various parameters such as the transmission rate and the population size, so you can see how different scenarios play out. You can also choose to see the simulation in real time or in a sped-up mode.

The epidemic simulation uses a simplified model of disease transmission based on a mathematical approach known as SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. By adjusting the parameters, you can see how a disease spreads through a population and how different interventions, such as vaccinations or quarantine measures, can affect the course of the epidemic.

The simulation is designed to be easy to use, and you can get started right away. Just head to nouhi.dev/epidemic-simulation and play around with the different settings to see how the simulation changes. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just someone curious about the dynamics of disease transmission, the epidemic simulation is a great way to explore these concepts in a fun and engaging way.
