# Epidemic Simulation

Epidemic simulation model developed for a pre-scientific paper on the spread of infectious diseases.

Created by Paul Menzel

## Test It Out Yourself

For trying out the simulation, it is hosted on my personal website: https://nouhi.dev/epidemic-simulation

It offers an interactive simulation that lets you adjust various parameters, such as the transmission rate and the population size, so you can see how different scenarios play out. It also features a live-updating graph, so you can see the course of infection in real time.

## Model Description

The epidemic simulation uses a simplified model of disease transmission based on a mathematical approach known as the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. By adjusting the parameters, you can see how a disease spreads through a population and how different interventions, such as vaccinations or quarantine measures, can affect the course of the epidemic.

The simulation is designed to be easy to use, and you can get started right away. Just head to `nouhi.dev/epidemic-simulation` and play around with the different settings to see how the simulation changes. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or just someone curious about the dynamics of disease transmission, the epidemic simulation is a great way to explore these concepts in a fun and engaging way.

**IMPORTANT**
- For optimal performance, it is recommended to ***enable hardware acceleration*** in your browser.

## Contributing & Ways to improve

In its current state, this software performs exactly as it should. However, as always, there is always room for improvement.

I have tried to simplify the code and comment it so anyone can read it and start contributing.
